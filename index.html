                            Though I only attended the University for two short years, Davis quickly became a second home to me. I was lucky enough to transfer to the school from community college along with some friends I had made, and they pushed me to be the best student, mentor, and friend that I could be. Davis is where I realized just how broad of a field Computer Science is, and where I was connected with my first real programming jobs. It's where I found opportunities to study abroad and learn about other cultures, even as I learned more about the culture I lived in every day. It's where I made lifelong friends and pursued my passion. I'll always be thankful for the experiences Davis provided me. Go Aggies!

                            Las Positas College helped me find my drive. Continuing to live at my childhood home as many of my friends went off to attend celebrated four-year universities was a humbling experience and helped me to focus on my education with gusto. As a Computer Science student, I got connected with other programmers, engineers, and scientists who were just as dedicated to success as I was. As a peer tutor, I found a home in the tutorial center with many of those brilliant people and was able to give back to the school and help others find their drive as I had.

This was my first introduction to more modern web development and in designing a web application from scratch. Over the course of three months I was able to become proficient in all of the languages, technologies, and packages used (Handlebars, Bootstrap, etc.) and personally implement the majority of the front-end work as well as a significant portion of the back-end infrastructure.
